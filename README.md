# Tic-Tac-Toe-AI

A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built in Kotlin with a computer opponent using a basic AI strategy. The game is presented through a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing.

## Features

- Play against an AI that uses both strategic and random moves.
- Clean and simple GUI for a 3x3 game board.
- Win/Draw detection with an option to play again.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vinhdq842/Tic-Tac-Toe-AI.git
   ```

2. **Open in IntelliJ IDEA** or any Kotlin-supported IDE and run the `main` function from `Main.kt`.

## Gameplay

* **X** is the player, and **O** is controlled by the AI.
* Click any empty space to make your move. The AI responds automatically.
* After the game ends, you'll have the option to play again.

### AI

The AI chooses moves with:

* 80% strategy-driven decisions.
* 20% random moves for variety.
